Task 1. Checking the integrity of the contents of the directory.

Calculate the hash sum of files (for each file separately) in a given directory, bypassing all subdirectories.
Save this information for further integrity checking.
Check the integrity of the directory with an indication of the changed files.
Algorithm for calculating the HASH sum. The file is read as a binary stream.
The stream is split into 16-bit segments, which are added by XOR.
If there are not enough bits up to 16 in the last segment, the missing bits are padded with zeros.
