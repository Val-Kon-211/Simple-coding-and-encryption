Directory encryption.
Write a directory encryption program that uses the following algorithm:
1) encryption:
a) the directory for encryption is specified to the program
b) the program is given a key
c) the program collapses the directory into an encrypted file
d) the program deletes the directory (it is possible in the usual way, without overwriting the body)
2) decryption:
a) the directory for decryption is specified to the program
b) the program is given a key
c) the program expands the encrypted file into a directory
d) the program deletes the file
The Vigenere encryption algorithm is used.
You cannot use the standard functions for folding a directory into a file, such as the built-in zip functions.
